Abstract of the proposed system:

Introduction:

It is an online furniture shop that allows users to check out the various furniture available at the online store and shop online. Users can browse through these products according to categories.

This online furniture shop is used to automate furniture selling online and it is implemented with an inventory management system.

Objective:

The website provides a list of furniture products displayed online in various models and designs. If a user likes a product, he can add it to his shopping cart.

It provides the user Id and Password by which one can login to the site. User can select any payment option that he wishes to like credit card or cash on delivery. Once the transaction is successful, the user receives a copy of the purchase receipt on his email id.

Thus, the aim of this online furniture-shopping project is to bring an entire furniture shop online and make it easy for both buyer and seller to make furniture deals.

Scope:

This will track the complete inventory of the shop. This project has a unique feature where a customer can customize orders according to choice.

It will guide the customers on how they can create space in their home and help them decorate their house to match the furniture they are planning to buy.

Existing System:

Having no online platform for furniture stores limits scope to specific locations only. Customers have to travel and visit the stores and it wastes their time. Also convenient choices are not provided the maximum number of times.

Online furniture stores let people all around the country know about the designs of various furniture products but sometimes because of misleading pictures customers don't always get what is shown online. Also due to lack of personal services people don't prefer shopping online.

Proposed System:

Traveling time and expenditures are incredibly saved with a single click on the Smartphone, PC, etc. A wide range of options are accessible, there are no restrictions to the plans, styles, materials and cost which makes the shopping experience a lot simpler and better.
